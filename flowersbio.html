	<p> Flowers is an opaque black being with an elastic, rubber-like body composition, being able to stretch to an immeasurable length. Foliage and plant life sprout from its body. Flowers can shape-shift into players, myths, and objects almost perfectly, with the only way to discern it and the object it mimics is its slurred speech. Flowers' origins are virtually unknown, theorized to have existed since the beginning of Roblox. The way you'll know Flowers is nearby is if you hear whistling, which has abnormal effects on any listeners, usually warping the victim's psyche until they leave, or they die.  <p>
