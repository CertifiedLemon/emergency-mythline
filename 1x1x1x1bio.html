	<p> 1x1x1x1 is a fungus that grows into domino-like shapes. It releases spores and infects Roblox players, banning their account, and their player avatar is bound to the game they were last in, unless somehow removed from the experience
The player will have less control over themselves until they are kicked and banned. Their avatar, over the period of 20 minutes, will sprout fungi and have a green hue spread on the avatar. 1x1x1x1's origins are currently unknown, but it's assumed to be first spotted in 2008. Only a few screenshots had surfaced and capturing 1x1x1x1 is next to impossible since it's nearly impossible to locate it. </p>
