	<h3> What Are Myths? </h3>
	<p> Myths are a category of threats to Roblox and its games, and the reason they're called "myths" are because of how rare a sighting, let alone an attack occurs. Myths come in many shapes, sizes, and traits. Some are exploiters who use hacking software for bad intentions, others are glitches and bugs, and a few myths have unidntifiable traits and we can never be certain if its a glitch, or a player.</p>
	<h3> How Do You Stop Myths? </h3>
	<p> Once we are notified about a myth, we will join the experience and detain the myth with whatever means necessary. Depending on how dangerous the myth is, more people will be called in for assistance. If the myth is too difficult to detain, the servers will be shut down for 2-5 hours.</p>
