	The three children watched in awe <br>
	the vibrant star swayed, <br>
	at that moment, the children knew <br>
	their creator was in pain. <br>

	The other beasts that sprouted from her <br>
	fell to the ground and died, <br>
	the chosen ones froliced in joy, <br>
	the sun had finally shined. <br> </h3>
